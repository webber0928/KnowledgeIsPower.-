# Actions on Google: Number Genie Sample using Node.js and Cloud Functions for Firebase

This guess a number game, called Number Genie, is an action for the Google Assistant.

## Localization

This app uses the [i18n-node](https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node) library to provide
responses in both French and English. The responses are listed in the `locales` directory.
In each function execution, the `strings.js` `setLocale()` function is called to
set the i18n-node locale based on the user locale in the incoming request. Prompts are then
selected by i18n-node from the available languages, defaulting to `en` if the
user's language is unavailable.


## Setup Instructions

See the developer guide and release notes at [https://developers.google.com/actions/](https://developers.google.com/actions/) for more details.

### Steps
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing.
1. Under *Build a custom app*, click *BUILD* in the Dialogflow box and then click *Create Actions on Dialogflow*.
1. Click *Save* to save the project.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `NumberGenie.zip` file in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the `functions` folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) and the static resources needed by the project using [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/):
    1. Follow the instructions to [install the Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart#install-the-firebase-cli).
    1. Run `firebase init`, and select to configure `Hosting` and `Functions`. Select the project you've previously created in the Actions on Google Console as default project. In the configuration wizard, accept all the default choices.
    1. Run `firebase deploy` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (numberGenie): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/numberGenie`. The command will also deploy the static assets at `https://${PROJECT}.firebaseapp.com/`.
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.
1. Select *Integrations* from the left navigation menu and open the *Settings* menu for Actions on Google.
1. Click *Test*.
1. Click *View* to open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type "Talk to my test app" in the simulator, or say "OK Google, talk to my test app" to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
