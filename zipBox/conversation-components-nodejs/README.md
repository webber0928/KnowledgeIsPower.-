# Actions on Google: Conversation Component Sample

A simple sample showing the visual conversation components available with Actions on Google.

## Setup Instructions

### Steps for Actions SDK
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing.
1. Choose *Actions SDK* in the *Add actions to your app* section. A dialog pops up: leave it open because you will need it for an upcoming step.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the `functions` folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
   1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply "N" when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
   1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (conversationComponent): https://us-central1-YOUR_PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/conversationComponent`
1. Update the action package, `action.json`, replacing the placeholder value `YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL` with the value for Function URL obtained from the previous step.
1. [Install the gactions CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli) if you haven't already.
1. Go back to the Actions console, copy the command shown in the Actions console, replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with "action.json" and execute it in a shell. The final command should look like `gactions update --action_package action.json --project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>`
1. Click *OK* in the Actions console to dismiss the *Use Actions SDK to add actions to your Assistant app* dialog.
1. Open the Simulator in the Actions console.
1. Type "Talk to my test app" in the simulator, or say "OK Google, talk to my test app" to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
