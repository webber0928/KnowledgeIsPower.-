# Actions on Google: Silly Name Maker Sample using Node.js and Cloud Functions for Firebase

This is a super simple Assistant app, built using Dialogflow and Node.js, to
generate a silly name based on your lucky number and favorite color.

## Setup Instructions

### Steps
1. Use the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com) to add a new project with a name of your choosing.
1. Under *Build a custom app*, click *BUILD* in the Dialogflow box and then click *Create Actions on Dialogflow*.
1. Click *Save* to save the project.
1. Click on the gear icon to see the project settings.
1. Select *Export and Import*.
1. Select *Restore from zip*. Follow the directions to restore from the `SillyNameMaker.zip` in this repo.
1. Deploy the fulfillment webhook provided in the functions folder using [Google Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/):
   1. Follow the instructions to [set up and initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#set_up_and_initialize_functions_sdk). Make sure to select the project that you have previously generated in the Actions on Google Console and to reply `N` when asked to overwrite existing files by the Firebase CLI.
   1. Run `firebase deploy --only functions` and take note of the endpoint where the fulfillment webhook has been published. It should look like `Function URL (sillyNameMaker): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT}.cloudfunctions.net/sillyNameMaker`
1. Go back to the Dialogflow console and select *Fulfillment* from the left navigation menu. Enable *Webhook*, set the value of *URL* to the `Function URL` from the previous step, then click *Save*.
1. In the `make_name` intent, check *End Conversation* for the section *Actions on Google*, then Save.
1. Open Dialogflow's *Integrations* page, open the *Settings* menu for *Actions on Google*, authorize by clicking *Authorize*, then click *Test*.
1. Click *View* to open the Actions on Google simulator.
1. Type `Talk to my test app` in the simulator, or say `OK Google, talk to my test app` to any Actions on Google enabled device signed into your developer account.
